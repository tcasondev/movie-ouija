This app was created as the first capstone project for Thinkful's engineering immersion program. 

About the app:
Movie Ouija was created both for fun and as a class project. I intend to use it as a proof-of-concept for a larger project in the future.

Movie Ouija is a way to settle the debate of "What are we going to watch tonight?". Surrender control and let the spirits decide. If you're worried, this app makes no effort to perform any actual religious or spiritual rituals. It's just the ghosts in the machines.

Movie-Ouija uses React.js with vanilla CSS to present the front-end and express, nodejs, and postgresql to manage the back-end. 

Summary: This app allows the user to keep a list of movies to which they have access and randomly generate one to watch from their collection. They can curate this choice by genre if they prefer but that is not required. 

Future updates: In the future I hope to implement a fun greeting to set the mood for the user as well as improved animations to add to the Ouija experience. I would also like to incorporate more powerful filters such as "Starring: " or "Subgenre: ".
